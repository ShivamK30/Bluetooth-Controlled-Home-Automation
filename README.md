# Bluetooth-Controlled-Home-Automation
Our project is a voice signal controlled home automation system. First the input signal is given by us in form of voice, that voice is converted to text by an app designed by us. This text signal is then sent to Arduino via Bluetooth module. The output of the Arduino is the input for the relay module which is used to control our fan and bulb.
